## Bylaws

### Article I: Mission & Philosophy

The C&R exists to promote the ancient art of taking a pleasant walk on nice lawns with friends, occasionally interrupted by the hitting of small white balls toward distant holes.

### Article II: Membership

1. **Open Enrollment**: Any person who believes golf is fundamentally about having a good time is eligible for membership
2. **Founding Principles**: Members must acknowledge that the perfect round exists somewhere between aspiration and reality
3. **Character Requirement**: Must be able to laugh at their own golf swing

### Article III: Rules of Play

1. **The 84 Standard**: All courses shall be considered playable to an 84, regardless of actual difficulty
2. **Zen Juice Protocol**: Consumption of scotch whisky from a flask is not only permitted but encouraged, particularly after poor shots
3. **Dew Sweeper Priority**: Early morning players have bragging rights for the remainder of the day
4. **Foot Wedge Rule**: Improving one's lie is acceptable when it enhances the overall enjoyment of the round
5. **Gallery Rule**: All shots witnessed by others automatically improve by one stroke category

### Article IV: Scoring & Handicaps

1. **Optimistic Scoring**: When in doubt, round down
2. **Weather Adjustments**: Scores may be adjusted for adverse conditions including (but not limited to): wind, rain, sun glare, allergies, and general malaise
3. **Equipment Malfunctions**: Clubs, balls, and tees are subject to temporary failures that may affect scoring

### Article V: Course Etiquette

1. **Pace of Play**: Slow play is acceptable when accompanied by good conversation
2. **Lost Ball Policy**: After a reasonable search (defined as "when someone suggests giving up"), drop a ball and play on
3. **Sand Trap Philosophy**: Bunkers are temporary obstacles, not permanent residences

### Article VI: Annual Traditions

1. **Founders Day**: Annual recognition of Mark Ayers and Dean Chase's vision
2. **Dew Sweeper Championship**: Early morning tournament for the truly dedicated
3. **Zen Juice Appreciation Day**: Celebration of the medicinal properties of course-side scotch

### Article VII: Amendments

These bylaws may be amended by majority vote of members present during any round where someone actually shoots an 84.

_Golf_: a walk on a nice lawn with friends.
